			<p id = "p1"> <span>Chiken Korma</span> Chicken Korma Curry is one of those magical dishes that seems to fill up 95% of my plate whenever I visit an Indian food buffet. It is rich, creamy, full of spices and flavor, and just begs to be soaked up by a piece of fresh naan. If you’ve never tried your hand at making Indian food at home, this should definitely be your starter recipe. It’s much easier than you’d think, as long as you have a few basic Indian spices in your pantry. The korma chicken does like to marinate for a while, so get it set in the morning before heading to work. </p>

			<p id = "p2"><span>Beef Massala Curry</span> This is one of those outrageously delicious curries, which will make you mop your plate clean and ask for more. We love curry and for us it’s something that’s never boring. It’s so comforting, spicy-sweet-savory and it just generally puts me in a good mood about life. Most of my life revolves around food that is quick and easy and I’m always looking for shortcuts or ways to save time. Using the Instant Pot often is one of my favorite shortcuts of all times! Easy to use and cuts cooking time by hours!</p>

			<p id = "p3"> <span>Suchi SPICY SHIITAKE ROLL</span> Dried shiitake mushrooms are lovely, and work incredibly well in sushi—their chewy and dense texture actually works better than fresh shiitake, and they hold up well to deep-frying. Adding some rich and spicy sriracha-Vegenaise sauce makes everything melt together here fabulously, producing a heavenly bite of sushi that’s also very easy to make.</p>
